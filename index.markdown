## Education

I completed Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Indian
Institute of Technology, Patna on May 2018. Following courses
influenced me the most as part of this journey:

* Bachelors Thesis in Natural Language Processing using Deep 
  Learning
* Artificial Intelligence
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Computer Networks
* Operating Systems

I spent the next four years working as a Software and Systems 
Engineer in the industry. During this period my interests 
swelled in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. This was 
primarily due to the research conducted while writing my 
bachelors thesis.

This motivated me to pursue a diploma in Data Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. Notable courses in the 
diploma program were:

* Statistics
* Machine Learning Foundations and Techniques
* Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and Combinatorics

Time management was crucial as I was pursuing diploma while 
working full-time. I spent most of the latter half of 2021 
applying for data science masters programs in North America 
which led to an offer from University of Toronto in early 2022.

As soon as I received my diploma in August 2022, I moved to 
Canada to pursue Masters in Applied Computing program from
University of Toronto. These four courses shaped my masters 
experience:

* Internship at AMD, Markham on Computer Vision for Video Games
* Deep Learning and Neural networks
* Statistical Machine Learning
* Computational Imaging

I will be completing my masters degree in December 2023.
