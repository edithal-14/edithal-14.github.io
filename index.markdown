### Present

At the User Experience Group at [AMD, Markham](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/contact/locations/markham-ontario), we are working at the cross-roads of Computer 
Vision, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to improve gaming experience using Radeon Software. 

### Masters in Applied Computing @ University of Toronto

I finished the [Masters in Applied Computing](https://mscac.utoronto.ca) program at the University of Toronto with specialization in Artificial Intelligence on December 2023. These four courses shaped my masters experience:

* Internship at AMD, Markham on Computer Vision for Video Games
* Deep Learning and Neural networks
* Statistical Machine Learning
* Computational Imaging

### Diploma in Data Science @ IIT Madras

In order to focus in the Artificial Intelligence domain after working in the software engineering sector for four years, I decided to pursue a diploma.
I completed an online diploma program in Data Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras on July 2022. Notable courses in this program were:

* Statistics
* Machine Learning Foundations and Techniques
* Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and Combinatorics

### Senior Member Technical @ D. E. Shaw India

I worked with the Systems team from 2018 to 2022.
The Systems team developed and managed internal applications to provide software infrastructure to the entire firm.
As a full stack DevOps Engineer, I had to develop, test and maintain internal applications.
I also worked as on-call escalation support for maintaining our Windows and Linux servers and applications running on them.
Some notable examples of internal applications include:

* Hardware Inventory management
* Permission management
* Credential manager which runs locally for fast access to resources
* Slack app integration for critical server alerts

### Bachelors in Computer Science @ IIT Patna

I completed Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Indian
Institute of Technology, Patna on May 2018. Following courses
influenced me the most as part of this journey:

* Bachelors Thesis in Natural Language Processing using Deep 
  Learning
* Artificial Intelligence
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Computer Networks
* Operating Systems

During my second year, I completed a 3 months long summer internship at [Cigniti](https://www.cigniti.com/), Hyderabad, India.
Here, I explored cloud services to develop machine learning pipelines using drag and drop UI and deploy them in cloud.
This is when I completed the famous Coursera machine learning course by Andrew Ng.

My third year saw me work as a summer intern at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/locations), Chennai, India.
I was able to secure this internship due to recommendation by my bachelors thesis supervisor, [Prof. Asif Ekbal](https://www.asifekbal.com/).
The work I had done at [AI-NLP-ML lab](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/) in IIT Patna under his supervision was useful in this internship.
I created a pipeline to extract the contents from a corpus of research papers in medical domain. Clean and extract **TF-IDF** features from the contents. Built an unsupervised clustering model using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to extract meaningful cluster of topics from the corpus.
